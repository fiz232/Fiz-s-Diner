# Fiz's Diner

## Online food ordering application

## Challenges

- Bootstrap helped alot with styling of the application, but also messed up some of the functionalities. For example, buttons did not work after drop-down menu is added and vise versa. But fortunately it was fixed by changing all button tags in the ejs files with <a> tag with "btn" class.
- For unknown reason, clicking on the "delete" button triggers the logout function after the drop-down menu was implemented, but was fixed by changing the logout route.
- I could not figure out how to implement the "add to cart" function and link it to the responding buttons.

## Technology in use

- NodeJS
- Nodemon
